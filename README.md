After reading a book called 'Rock Breaks Scissors', I was inspired to make a game/machine where the machine wins more often than the player does.

There is no cheating by picking the choice after the user. In fact it chooses its next pick immediately after the results are in. 

It is not 100% done yet but it is easy to see the computer has a slight edge at this point.
